This is going to be the start of a blog of my tinkering. I've been playing with a few interesting things lately, so I thought it'd be good to write about it. Since I have promised myself that I will finish off a few Arduino projects and up-skill with creating music, expect them to appear here too.

If you're not sure who I am, my name's Mathew, and I'm a technology geek based in Wellington. I'm [Storypark's](https://www.storypark.com) CTO, and co-organise [wellington.js](https://www.meetup.com/wellingtonjs) and [WellRailed](https://www.meetup.com/wellrailed). Outside of hours I enjoy mixing and dancing to music, and a good craft beer with good company.

I have a history of taking things apart, which is likely to appear here too.
